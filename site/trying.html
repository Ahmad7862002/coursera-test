<p>The Greatest Showman is a 2017 American musical drama film directed by Michael Gracey in his directorial debut, written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and starring Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya. Featuring nine original songs from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the film was inspired by the story of P. T. Barnum's creation of Barnum's American Museum and the lives of its star attractions.

Principal photography began in New York City in November 2016. The film premiered on December 8, 2017, aboard RMS Queen Mary 2. It was released in the United States on December 20, 2017, by 20th Century Fox, seven months after Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus ceased operations, and grossed $435 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing live-action musical of all time.</p>
<p>The film was criticised for its artistic license, with some reviewers calling it "faux-inspiring and shallow"[4][5][6], but was praised for the performances, music, and production values, and received nominations for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actor – Musical or Comedy for Jackman at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for the song "This Is Me", was nominated for Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards[7] and won the Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.[8]</p>
